## Increment savings, Increment nature…
November 04, 2020

## Overview 
             It is the need of the hour to ask ourselves the question, “Are we to leave our successors a scorched planet of advancing deserts, impoverished landscapes and ailing environment?” If we want to give the answer as NO, then we need to follow the ideas of sustainable development. To keep holding the roots of nature along with development, TEAM BINARY comes up with an application called  i$Plant, which is a source for saving the world and earning money for yourself. The focus of this app is on two wheels of development, finance and nature. It rewards the user for 1) planting a new sapling and taking care of it, 2) providing statistical data for leading companies by cutting the cost.
             
## Goals 
1. Nurturing nature: Simply planting the sapling is not enough, we will be monitoring the well being of the plant too. Rewards will be given on the basis of the type of plant and its nurturing.
2. Decentralised information: This helps in the accountability, improved traceability and transparency of the information. Further avoiding duplication of users for the sake of rewards.
3. Survey for statistical data: The information will not be distorted and the maintenance cost will be low.

## Working Methodology 
     The working of the application deals with the information which will be stored in Ethereum blockchain. The app design will be useful for  monitoring and analysing the plant data. It will also act as the interface for the extraction of data. The money will be generated from the surveys and will be further divided into two parts, i.e.,  for the application maintenance and to rewards for users planting a sapling and filling the form data. It includes a Machine learning based algorithm which classifies different plants based on their leaves.
